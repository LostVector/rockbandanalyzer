                    <p>Rock Band Analyzer is a site I designed mainly as a learning exercise for all things Java and Google.

                    Around March 2008, I picked up an electronic drum kit and connected it to Rock Band.  I even wrote a huge FAQ about
                    how to do it to Rock Band.
                    Around August of 2008, I got a little restless ... so, to keep my head sharp, I wrote a Java library
                    and executable wrapper targeted at generating
                    optimal paths through expert drum charts in Rock Band.  I was reasonably successful, but I didn't find the motivation
                    to purchase hosting or release the source code in a form that would be usable.
                    </p>

                    <p>In April 2009, Google announced Google App Engine would now support Java.  App Engine is
                    a free hosting environment for scalable applications, so this prompted me to start work again.
                    Now I can host a site for free, learn tons about deploying a real web application in Java,
                    and give back to the Rock Band community all at the same time.  Sold!
                    </p>

                    <p>Of course, as the site develops and becomes actually useful, I find more and more ways to add onto it.
                    I plan on continuing to add stats and interesting data wherever I find the time. I've also designed the site
                    to be as self serve as possible so that people having to wait for other people to generate paths through songs
                    will be a thing of the past.
                    </p>

                    <p>As opposed to many people who write programs for the Rock Band community, I have made the source code and
                    data available so that others will hopefully be able to build on the work.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to Harmonix for making such an amazing game.  Thanks to Google for providing free hosting
                    via Google App Engine and paying my bills.  Thanks to ScoreHero for such a vibrant community.</p>
