                    <p>The Rock Band Analyzer is a special site that I designed to parse,
                    generate, and manage all kinds of interesting data about Rock Band songs.  For example,
                    find out the highest scoring
                    paths through a song on a particular instrument, the distribution of songs released so far
                    by genre, or how many songs have been released by a particular artist.</p>

                    <p>This site is under very early development, but the foundation is there for some
                    really cool features to be released in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
